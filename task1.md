# Test Task 1: Web IDE for Remote Development: Implementation Plan

[Task 2: ]

## Introduction

For me, this project is a breath of fresh air. I love front-end development, but I would like to stand out from the thousands of other web developers like me. This project is an opportunity to learn something new and unusual. I see great prospects in this.

## Basic Development Steps

### 1. Integration of Fleet and Monaco Editor
- Goal: As I understand it, the key step to solving this problem is the integration of Fleet and Monaco Editor. We need to ensure that Monaco can effectively interact with Fleet to process code and file requests. To do this, Fleet needs to be able to work in a browser.
- Implementation:
   - We can compile part of it into JavaScript or WASM
   - I would also use Kotlin Multiplatform to ensure code compatibility between different platforms.

### 2. User Interface Development
- Goal: Creating an intuitive and user-friendly user interface. Everything here is simple and logical. The difficulty can only lie in implementation.
- Key Aspects:
   - UI/UX design with an emphasis on ease of navigation and quick edits.
   - Responsive and cross-browser design.
   - Optimized performance and security.

### 3. Testing
- Goal: Ensuring stable operation and compatibility of all application components is also an important task.
- Actions:
   - Regular testing of Fleet and Monaco integration.
   - Testing the functionality of the web application in different browsers.

### 4. Collecting Feedback
- Goal: Adaptation of the product to the needs of users. This will be key to the SUCCESS of the project. Helps us accurately understand user needs and tailor the product accordingly.
- Methods:
   - Surveys and interviews with potential users.
   - Iterative implementation of changes based on received feedback.

## Interaction with the Team. I add this point because I think this is an important aspect in the implementation of the project, despite the fact that most likely the development of the project is implied.

- Effective Communication: Regular meetings and common communication channels to ensure consistency of work.
- Flexibility and Understanding of Tasks: Willingness to change and understanding of key technologies and project tasks.
- Teamwork and Support: Maintaining a spirit of teamwork and mutual assistance.

## Conclusion

The project offers opportunities for a creative approach to front-end development and requires a deep understanding of modern technologies and flexibility in implementing tasks.
